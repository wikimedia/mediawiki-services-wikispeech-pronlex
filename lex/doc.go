/*Package lex is used for general 'container' classes such as entry, transcription, lemma, etc.

The main unit here is the entry. The entry contains everything related to a lexicon entry: orthography, transcriptions, lemma, compound parts, sources/references, et cetera.
It is implemented as a go struct, and it can automatically be mapped into a JSON object.

The Entry struct is defined here: https://godoc.org/github.com/stts-se/pronlex/lex#Entry

The corresponding JSON may look like this:
